The problem at hand is also known as the Collatz conjecture, and states that given any positive integer 
N will converge to 1 if we apply the algorithm mentioned in the statement.So far, no one really knows whether the conjecture holds for any given N, 
so it remains an unsolved problem in mathematics.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long

#define pb push_back
#define x first
#define y second

int32_t main()
{
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    while (n != 1) {
        cout << n << " ";
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            n /= 2;
        } else {
            n = 3 * n + 1;
        }
    }
    cout << 1;
}
